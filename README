Working parts:
aws, backend (prefix,search,suffix), client, monitor

aws.c: the server that clients make requests to. it sends the request to backend servers and aggregates response to send to monitor and client
aws_routines.cpp: includes functions like data aggregation 
aws_routines.h: header for file above
backend.cpp: includes functions for searching/prefixing input and also message formatting. also has some data structures I implemented
backend.h: header for file above
client.c: client app
monitor.c: monitor app
serverX (A,B,C): server app

Format of Messages:

Output format (from backend/to monitor):
DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING: 0&INPUT
SEARCH AND FOUND SIMILAR: 1&INPUT&VALUE&WORD&DEFINITION
SEARCH AND DIDN'T FIND SIMILAR: 1&INPUT&VALUE
DIDNT FIND BUT FOUND SIMILAR: 1&&INPUT&WORD&DEFINITION
PREFIX/SUFFIX: (2/3)&n&INPUT&VALUE1&VALUE2&VALUE3...&VALUEn

Message format (to client):
If not found: '&\0'
If search: 'VALUE\0'
If prefix or suffix: 'n&VALUE1&VALUE2&VALUE3...&VALUEn\0'

Request format (from client):
SEARCH: 1&INPUT
PREFIX: 2&INPUT
SUFFIX: 3&INPUT


I used code from Beej's network programming guide, specifically from client.c, server.c, listener,c and talker.c

Prefix function fails under high amounts of data, ie number of words > 50
